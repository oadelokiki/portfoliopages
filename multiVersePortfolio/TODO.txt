What I have done:
--> i've set up hosting for each of the three html pages that i'll need, and i've set up routes for endpoints on each of the pages.
--> I've set up boilerplate code for each page, and labeled what each one is for.


What I have left to do:
-->I need to really come up with a solid design, understand some funtionalities that i'd like to add to the site, but also create a decent wireframe in figma for the first time.

--> I'll have to create wireframe/learn figma , learn some css, learn some some bootsrap, and likely catch up a bit on coding rooms in order to learn the css principles that I'll need, but I think I can create a decent looking site without too much assistance. 

--> Let's see if I cna do some extension work, and create a data-driven, interactive portion of the site.
